As a user 
I need a remark function  
So that I can mark what i don't want in my dish.
   
 ### Details and Assumptions
 when I order my food, I want to custom it to meet my needs. 
Also, some people have allergies, so it would be great if they could customize their orders.
   
 ### Acceptance Criteria  
   
 ```gherkin
 Given the remark function
 When the user chooses a menu
 Then show the remark in the cart
 ```
